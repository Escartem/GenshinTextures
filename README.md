# This repo received a DMCA takedown from MiHoYo, all of the textures are removed from the repository and it's commit history.
## This is sad to see this repo end after that many months but it is the way of things I guess, the discussions are still enabled if you want to talk and i'll leave the link to my discord server if you have any questions : [![Discord Banner 2](https://discordapp.com/api/guilds/503554429648371712/widget.png?style=shield)](https://discord.gg/fzRdtVh)

**Please describe the nature of your copyright ownership or authorization to act on the owner's behalf.**

We are the copyright owner of the game Genshin Impact, see https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/

**Please provide a detailed description of the original copyrighted work that has allegedly been infringed. If possible, include a URL to where it is posted online.**

Dear,

This is COGNOSPHERE PTE. LTD. We are here to report a few infringing repositories on Github. Without our authorization, the links identified herein contain and display openly the codes/source codes of our game package, which have constituted as a copyright infringement as well as a violation of the Terms of Service of the game.

The infringing URLs are:

1, [https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinTextures](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinTextures)

We find that the “**Texture2D**” folder in this repository contains our codes decoded from our game package. Check [https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinTextures/tree/master/Texture2D/Avatar](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinTextures/tree/master/Texture2D/Avatar) for example.

Meanwhile, in the “readme” part, the creator of this repo clearly states that it contains “All Genshin Impact textures extracted from game such as map and characters textures, items icons, ui and other stuff”, which further proves our point.

2，[https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes)

It is from the same creator who decodes our game package. For example, the file in [https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes/blob/master/VideoAssets/LongWangStroy/Cs_LYAQ1112308_LongWangStroy.mp4](https://github.com/Escartem/GenshinCutscenes/blob/master/VideoAssets/LongWangStroy/Cs_LYAQ1112308_LongWangStroy.mp4) is video from our game.

The infringement has caused a great harm to us. We request a permanent removal of the repositories.

Many thanks!

**What files should be taken down? Please provide URLs for each file, or if the entire repository, the repository’s URL.**

The entire repositories we mentioned above should be removed.
