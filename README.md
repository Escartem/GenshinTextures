## A few details

* There is around 95% of all game textures
* They were all sorted as there is around 30,000 files, see bellow for some reference

<details>
    <summary>Interesting files location</summary>

* Characters textures
```
/Texture2D/Avatar/[Character type]/[Weapon type]/[Character name]/Tex/
``` 
(if texture is missing some parts remove alpha channel from file)

* NPC textures
```
/Texture2D/NPC/[NPC type or region]/ 
```

* Map

For models and terrain textures
```
/Texture2D/Area/ 
```
Md → Mondstadt 

Ly → Liyue

Inazuma and Sumeru are probably following the same logic


For base map texture and tint

```
/Texture2D/BigWorldTerrain/ 
```

For fog

```
/Texture2D/BigWorld/ 
``` 

* Characters cards
```
/Texture2D/UI/AvatarIcon/ 
```

* Chat stickers 
```
/Texture2D/UI/EmotionIcon1~224/
```

* Events tutorials and others textures
```
/Texture2D/UI/Activity/[Event name]/
```
Some textures are also in folders starting with Activty 

* If you want to have nightmares with cursed characters
```
/Texture2D/Eff/UI/Activity/Reunion/
/Texture2D/Eff/UI/Activity/RogueDiary/
/Texture2D/Eff/UI/Activity/SummerTimeV2/
/Texture2D/Eff/UI/Activity/WinterCamp/
```
